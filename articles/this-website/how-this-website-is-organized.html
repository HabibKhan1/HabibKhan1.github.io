<h1>How This Website is Organized</h1>
        
<button class = "button" onclick = "darkmode()"><p id = "button">Toggle dark mode</button>

<p>One may wonder, how is this website organized? Well, let's look at <a href = "https://github.com/HabibKhan1/HabibKhan1.github.io">its GitHub repository</a>!</p>
<p>Taking a look at this, we see several files/directories, along with <a href = "https://github.com/HabibKhan1/HabibKhan1.github.io/blob/main/README.md">a README</a>,
a <a href = "https://github.com/HabibKhan1/HabibKhan1.github.io/blob/main/arch.png">website logo</a>, some JavaScript, CSS, and a home page (in HTML, of course.)</p>
<img src = "/img/github-repo.png" alt = "The GitHub repository">
<p>The index.html file constitutes the HTML for the home page. Every folder has one of these. Basically, if you refer your browser to one of these folders (like, for
instance, my <a href = "/about/">about page</a>), it will use the index.html file by default to display what will be on your screen.</p>
<p>Sometimes, folders have more than one HTML file. Why is this the case? Well, sometimes, as is the case for the "articles" folder, there are multiple articles, of
course. So essentially, grouping HTML files in folders is purely for convenience.</p>
<img src = "/img/github-articles.png" alt = 'The "articles" folder'>
<img src = "/img/github-this-website.png" alt = 'The "this-website" folder in "articles"'>
<p>The "img" folder, on the other hand, is only for storing screenshots and images, like the ones shown.</p>
<p>So, that's basically how this website is organized! Hopefully, this clarifies the purpose of having so many folders in my repository.</p>
